# Population Data Visualization using World Bank Dataset

## Internship Task  
**Organization:** Prodigy InfoTech  
**Internship Track:** Data Science  
**Task Number:** Task-01  
**Project Type:** Data Visualization  
**Difficulty Level:** Beginner-Friendly  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of population data across countries using an official dataset provided by the World Bank. The objective of this task is to understand how population values are distributed globally by applying basic data visualization techniques.

The task emphasizes correct dataset selection, clean data preparation, and meaningful visualization to derive insights from real-world data. This serves as a foundational exercise for further data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks in the internship.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Source:** World Bank Open Data  
- **Indicator:** Total Population (SP.POP.TOTL)  
- **Dataset Link:**  
  https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%201  

The dataset contains population data for multiple countries from the year 1960 to 2022.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded the World Bank population dataset.
- Skipped metadata rows to access clean tabular data.
- Verified dataset structure and column information.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Selected population data for the year 2022.
- Removed missing values to ensure accurate visualization.
- Renamed columns for better readability and clarity.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Created a histogram to visualize the distribution of population values across countries.
- Used appropriate bin sizes to clearly represent population spread.
- Added labels and titles to enhance interpretability.

### 4. Insight Generation
- Interpreted the population distribution pattern.
- Identified skewness and outliers.
- Summarized observations in a concise and meaningful manner.

## 📊 Visualization Details
- **Visualization Type:** Histogram  
- **X-axis:** Population  
- **Y-axis:** Number of Countries  
- **Year Analyzed:** 2022  

The histogram helps in understanding how population values are distributed across countries worldwide.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- The population distribution is highly right-skewed.
- Most countries have relatively smaller populations.
- A small number of countries have extremely large populations, acting as outliers.
- Distribution analysis provides valuable context before deeper statistical analysis.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Analysis is limited to a single year (2022).
- The task focuses only on visualization, not trend analysis.
- Regional or demographic segmentation is not included in this task.
